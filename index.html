						<h3>About</h3>
						<br>
						<p>Ever since I was a student in Business, Strategy and Data has been my passion. I still remember making it print "Hello, Daniel" in python for the first time.
							As I went through the basic tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols,
							limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Throughout of the last years, I launched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from " Hello World",
							all the way to a Data Science. I learned Relational Databases,SQL, Python, R, JIRA, BI Tools, Excel, Git, Then Tableau in online courses I could find on anything 
							remotely related to Data Science.
							<br>	
							This passion carried me through my education. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined. I studied new languages, algorithms,
							data visualizations, product experimentations, regressions, linking data and analytics to business strategy and operations to drive real impact.
							<br>
							So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to analyze. And for this, 
							I am very grateful.
							<br>
							Specialities: Languages Python, R
							Academic: Strategy, Analytics, Data.
